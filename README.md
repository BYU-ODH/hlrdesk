## Requirements

* Node.js 0.12.x
* Postgres >= 9.3
* Redis

## Setup

### Configuration

You will need to set the following environment variables. The following
example is for a `~/.pam_environment` file on an Ubuntu machine. `npm start`
will attempt to evaluate this file (see `package.json` for details) if it
exists.

If you are running Dokku, specify the TZ environment variable to make
sure your time zone is accurate.

```bash
HLRDESK_DEV=true

# for false, uncomment the following line
#HLRDESK_DEV=

PORT=80 # this is unprefixed for Dokku's sake
HLRDESK_HOST=hlrdesk.byu.edu

# Postgres database values

PGPASSWORD=password
PGHOST=localhost
PGUSER=postgres
PGDATABASE=hlrdesk
PGPORT=5432
PGPOOLSIZE=10

# for Postgres versions < 9.4
PGPASS=password

#Google Analytics ID
GAID=UA-57856521-1

#Redis
REDIS_PORT=6379
REDIS_IP=hostname

# Email G00dness

EMAIL=hlr.dev.useyouremailN00Bulous@gmail.com
EMAILSERVICE=Gmail (note the cap)
EMAILPASS=my.password.here
```

## Commands

### Starting the server

`npm start`

### Sending reminder emails

You may want to automatically send out reminder emails to users about overdue
or soon-to-be due items.

```bash
# Send reminder emails for items that became due yesterday (and are now overdue)
npm run email-overdue

# Send reminder emails to users with items due within the next 24 hours
npm run email-reminder
```

### Testing

Test files can be found under `tests/`, with mock session data in
`tests/sessions/` and mock database data in `core/db/mock-data.sql`

Run `npm test` to run the tests.

### Deployment

Deployment to our servers can be done using one of the following commands and
should typically only take place through Travis.

```bash

# automatically run when code is merged into development
npm run deploy dev # to update hlrdesk.hlrdev.byu.edu

# automatically run when code is merged into staging
npm run deploy staging # to update hlrdesk-staging.byu.edu

# automatically run when a commit is tagged, preferably
# by adding a release through Github's interface.
# Pushing to production automatically updates the database on staging.
# It is assumed that staging is up-to-date when a tag is added.
npm run deploy production # to update hlrdesk.byu.edu
```

If you need to re-deploy on the server (the server is down), run `dokku deploy hlrdesk` on the server.
